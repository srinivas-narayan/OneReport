# OneReport
Project files for creating OneReport portal (for exchange of investigation reports amongst NHS entities)
This is a project created for Digital Health Hackday on 18 Jul 2019. The aim is to create a portal for exchange of reports of investigations across all NHS hospitals.
This would save valuable time for all NHS staff, who could concentrate on providing quality patient care instead of having to contact the other health providers for this information.
